Now that I’m at the end of this Data Science program, I’m excited about combining my new skills and appreciation for Data Science with my Masters in Design Management to create a storytelling opportunity in this space. 

### Why is it so hard?

When I was working the presentation for my first Data Science project, I found myself shocked with how my initial slides were so boring and technical rather than interesting or focused on the  business value of the results. Not only did it not tell a story but it also didn't look great. I got caught up in the process and student mindset that I forgot about my audience and the pitch aspect of this deliverable.

My second project came along and I found myself still stuck where some of the presentation was too technical and boring. So I reached out to my creative partner at work and asked her for some pointers. She directed me integrate icons and infographics as a way to tell the story. So I finally jumped back into my product manager mindset and below is the format that got me to one of my better [presentations](https://github.com/chelseapower/dsc-4-final-project-online-ds-pt-011419/blob/master/presentation.pdf).

* Frame the problem that your solving
* Show a competitive landscape
* Define the impacts the problem
* Highlight interesting results that drive to your solutions
* Make a clear recommendation

While the visual design, colors and layout has a lot of room for improvement, this is deck met all of the project requirements and conveys the storytelling around why the information is important. Following this format took additional time for research in order to build the story but it is well worth it. 

### What's next?

Over the past ten months of this program, I’ve also been read some interesting articles from [HBR](https://hbr.org/2019/01/data-science-and-the-art-of-persuasion), attended an [Edward Tufte one-day course](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses), and found myself impressed with [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/solutions/gallery/analysis-beatles) dashboards and other [data visualizations](https://blog.udacity.com/2015/01/15-data-visualizations-will-blow-mind.html). And the only thing that is super clear to me now is that my learning journey is not over. 

Besides the obvious next steps like reading my collection of Edward Tufte books, taking a Tableau course, participating in a Kaggle competition, or volunteering on a data science project I plan to focus my newly found free time on practicing the "art" of data storytelling. At the end of the day, if you can't explain why something is valuable and important, then all of your hard work can feel like a waste as it's deprioritized behind someone else great data story.
