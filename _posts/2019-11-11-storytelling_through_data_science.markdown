Now that I’m at the end of this Data Science program, I’m excited about combining my new skills and appreciation for Data Science with my Masters in Design Management to create a storytelling opportunity in this space. Over the past ten months of this program, I’ve read some interesting articles from (HBR](https://hbr.org/2019/01/data-science-and-the-art-of-persuasion), attended an [Edward Tufte one-day course](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses), and found myself impressed with [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/solutions/gallery/analysis-beatles) dashboards and other [data visualizations](https://blog.udacity.com/2015/01/15-data-visualizations-will-blow-mind.html). And the only thing that is super clear to me now is that my learning journey is not over.
