As a professional who has spent the majority of my career in operations management but transitioned into product managment about seven years ago, **Data Science** seemed like a smart next step and the type of challenge I was looking to take in my career. However, I wasn't prepared for how intense the part-time program would be. More on that later.

I'm currently working in financial services and our web and performance analytics only gets me so far in helping to guide some of the decisions I need to make as a Product Manager. Analyzing past data helps us validate what we've done but it doesn't help us model our efforts for the future. We are now at the scale where Data Science will be a critical aspect to maintaining competitive digital offering where we have predictive models supporting our strategic business decisions.

Now that I am over half way through the part-time program, I appreciate the quality of the curriculum, learning structure, video classes, resources, my cohort and most of all, the instructors. I started this program without any real advantages since the last time I had done basic programming and some advanced math was 18 years ago. If you happen to have some retained math and/or programming skills then you won't have to work as hard I have. And if you can't prioritize the program as the #2 or #3 thing in your life then it will be a struggle and difficult to complete while working a full-time job. It's fast-paced and even if you get time off over a project session, you'll probably end up working straight through the break. However, I do still highly recommend the program to anyone interested in Data Science.
