As an executive who has spent the majority of my career in operations management with a transition into product management about seven years ago, **Data Science** seemed like a smart next step and the type of challenge I wanted in my career journey. But, wow, I really underestimated how intense this online, part-time program would be. More on that later.

I've been working as the **Head of Product Management in financial services** for the past six years and the limited web and performance analytics data wasn't really helping to inform in the types of daily creative, operational, and business decisions that impacted the plans we managed. While analyzing past data can help to validate what has been done, without a data model sitting on top of that information, there is no real preventive or predictive outputs we easily derive and apply. The size and scale of how our plans have grown is finally at the scale where Data Science is a critical aspect to maintaining a competitive digital offering where predictive models guide the strategic business decisions and even help to automate some of the basic financial service processes. So I can't wait to bring these new skills back to my workplace. 

Now that I am over half way through the part-time program, I have come to really appreciate the quality of the curriculum, learning structure, video classes, resources, my cohort, and most of all, **the instructors**. I started this program without any real advantages since the last time I had done basic programming and advanced math was about 18 years ago. (If you happen to have some retained math and/or programming skills then you probably won't have to work as hard I have.) But more than the struggle of what it's like to be a student again, the time demands and tricky balancing act that's required between other personal and professional obligations have been the consistent struggle for me over the course of this program.

This type of endeavor really needs to be prioritized as the #2 or #3 thing in your life in order for you to be able to dedicate the time needed to get through it. Here was my list:

1. Work
2. My husband (I'm a newlywed) / data science program
3. Data science program / my husband
4. Sleep / exercise / fun stuff

As you can see, my #2 and #3 are basically the same as there have been times when I've had to make the flip flop them. Fortunately, I have a very supportive husband who has been okay taking the #3 slot from time to time.

As I've already mentioned, the pace of the program is very fast and I pretty much always like I am drinking from a firehose of new information. Here are a few tips I've learned along the way:

* **TIP 1: Let everyone close to you know that you're in this program.** You may be surprised how supportive your work colleagues, family and friends will be.
* **TIP 2: Try to not book an awesome vacation during this program.** I took my 2-week honeymoon and thought I was going to study and complete my work from Bhutan. Nope. So I had to hustle hard when I got back.
* **TIP 3: Look forward to the projects.** Even though they can be tough, they also brought me the confirmation I needed every 8 weeks that I had actually just learned something.
* **TIP 4: Be prepared to take time off work to get things done.** I've found myself regularly taking off at least one work day during the project assignments in order to get through it all. 
* **TIP 5: Don't let the project "break week" mislead you into believing that you have an extra week.** Trust me, you'll need all of the time given for the project. 

From my experience to date, I highly recommend this program to anyone interested in Data Science!
