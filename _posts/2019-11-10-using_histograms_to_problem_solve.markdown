For my first data science project, I used histograms several times in this assignment to evaluate the detailed distributions of my dataset. These visualizations are especially useful for taking an early look at data distrubutions to check to see which variables are normal or skewed. In the image below, you can see that my data for this project was very skewed.

After doing quite a bit of work to properly classify the data types, remove the outliers per variable, and then log transformed to them to see if normalizing the data helped to balance the data distribution.
